# Amiga_WernerAGA
WernerAGA, my first larger game written in Motorola 68K Assembler, back in 1995. Needs Amiga OS3 and AA Chipset.

Fun facts:

1. Some levels are so hard that I couldn't even manage to solve them by myself. One idea for today's deep learning era would be to apply the techniques from "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning" to this little game. Pull request, anyone? Seriously, we need something for the Amiga as well ;-)
2. I painted everything (the main character, the cops, the stones etc.) by myself, but I have never drawn the bottle: it's a stylized pictogram showing a white "F" (German word "Flasche" for bottle). Proposals for better graphics welcome.
3. Whoever wants to build this: I used the "O.M.A 2.0 Macro Assembler" in those days.
